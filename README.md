# Finacne Tracker Frontend

This is my final project for the TripleTen Bootcamp

## Description

I decided to make a custom bank transaction app that can help users better manage the transaction. My goal is to later add Goals and recieve charts based on how well they met their goals but I am not sure I will implement this in this project. This is the repo focusses on the frontend of the website.
There are two pages the main page where users can see their previous transactions. And a user page where they can see their account balance and see and make more transactions if they wish.
